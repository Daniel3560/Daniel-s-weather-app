My Simple Weather App
What This App Does
This is a website that shows you the current weather for any city in the world.

✨ Live Demo:https://daniel3560.github.io/Daniel-s-weather-app/  ✨


You type in a city name, and it tells you the temperature, what the weather feels like, how windy it is, humidity, and how cloudy it is.
The background of the page even changes to match the weather (like sunny for clear skies, or cloudy for clouds)!
